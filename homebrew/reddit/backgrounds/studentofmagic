			<p>You were formally trained in Magic, and the name of those that trained you can open doors. You can usually gain an audience with another magic user, simply by dropping the name of your Master or School. Furthermore, you can usually find a place to stay among scholars or magic users, unless you show yourself to be a danger to them. You may also have access to resources from those who taught you, whether that is access to your school’s libraries and facilities, or simply the ability to correspond with your Master and ask him or her for advice.</p>
